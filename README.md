# Assignment 3 - Python Banking Interest Calculator

## Description
This repository contains my third assignment for the bootcamp. It's a Python project that focuses on implementing classes, functions, and importing them to calculate the interest rate on bank account balances. The assignment was challenging and required several tweaks to ensure accuracy. After rigorous testing, I confirmed its functionality.

## Features
- Calculates interest rates for two types of accounts: Savings and CD accounts
- Utilizes classes and functions to manage account balances and interest calculations

## Folder Structure

- `account.py`: Contains classes and functions for managing account balances and interest calculations
- `cd_account.py` : Contain function to creat CD Account and Calculate interest
- `savings_account.py`: Contain function to creat Saving Account and Calculate interest
- `customer_banking.py`: in this file where the process take place and most of the inputs and prints.
